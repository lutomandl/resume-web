        Hi, I&apos;m Lubo≈°! I&apos;m a frontend engineer based in Berlin, with a
        passion for building dynamic and user-friendly web applications using
        React. When I&apos;m not coding, I&apos;m usually indulging in my other
        interests, like studying theology, playing guitar or bouldering.
        I&apos;m also a bit of a coffee snob, always on the lookout for the
        perfect brew. Thanks for stopping by my website, and feel free to get in
