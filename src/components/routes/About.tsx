        Hi, I'm Lubo≈°! I'm a frontend engineer based in Berlin, with a passion
        for building dynamic and user-friendly web applications using React.
        When I'm not coding, I'm usually indulging in my other interests, like
        studying theology, playing guitar or bouldering. I'm also a bit of a
        coffee snob, always on the lookout for the perfect brew. Thanks for
        stopping by my website, and feel free to get in touch on{' '}
